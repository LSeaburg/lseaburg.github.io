**Note**: *brat* is stylized several different ways: *brat*, *Brat*, and *BRAT*.  For this review I will style it consistently as *brat*, as that is consistently featured in the album art across all iterations.

It’s hard to overstate the cultural impact of *brat*.  *brat* was photoshoots and outfits.  *brat* was tote bags and friendship bracelets.  *brat* was birthday cakes.  People carved *brat* pumpkins.  *brat* meaningfully influenced a presidential election campaign.  Someone remade the entirety of *brat* in Mario Paint Composer (though the fact that [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jK2CXbWnhE) showed up in my recommended might say more about me than the album).

And *brat* is literally more than just the album.  *brat* is a color and a font.  *brat* is interviews and 3 music videos.  *brat* is a ‘vibe’.  *brat* is one of the craziest album rollouts of all time.  And *brat* is in fact 2 albums (3 if you’re being technical) - one of all the normal tracks, as released, and an entire new album with every single song remixed with new collaborators and features.

*brat* is the defining album of the 2020’s (so far, although it is hard to imagine that it will be surpassed).  Released July 7, with singles cemented so atop the lists of “songs of the summer”, people instead deemed the entire season after the album - “brat summer” was the summer of 2024.  The season continued into “brat autumn” as well, as the remix album, released on October 11, continues to be relevant.  

But what’s more, this cultural domination has captured the essence of the 2020’s more so than anything else to date.  The very choices of the color and font on the album cover scream of the “awkward cozy” that has come to define Gen Z; it is at once unapologetic in itself, but feels right at home in this strange world we find ourselves in.  Much of this cultural domination was, naturally, mediated largely though social media, and I currently (if naively) feel that will be increasingly hard to replicate.  Platforms are becoming more fractured.  Presently at the time of writing TikTok is banned in the US, unavailable on both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.  Attempting to mobilize across all the varied platforms seems increasingly difficult.

Plus TikTok was responsible for a large portion of it.  Memes, dances, arts and crafts - *brat* was a meme everywhere, all at once.  It is the 2020’s idea of what a meme is, what a meme can be. 

As for the music I can only say that it’s extremely original and quite groundbreaking.  I predict that it will have a massive effect on pop music production for years to come.  It was able to be artistically exciting while also gaining mass appeal which I find relatively rare.  

I don’t feel too much more needs to be said about the music.  The status of the album in popular culture speaks for itself.  

Personally, though, I will say that while only being a minor Charli xcx fan in years past I, according to my end-of-year-review, listened enough *brat* to play the album from start to finish about 19 times.  It was my most listened to album, and Charli XCX was my most listened to artist.

This could certainly influence my bias when assessing the merits of this album.  But I really believe that it has done what no other album could do.  It crazed a generation to push the art forward because it dared to be different.  It dared to be *brat*.
